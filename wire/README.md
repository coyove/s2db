# Introduction

go-redisproto is a go library to create server, service for RPC that compatible with redis protocol
I use it for some projects that require RPC, redis-protocol is a good choice because it can be parsed fast and
we have many client libraries that already exist to use. go-redisproto use it's own buffered reader to avoid memory copy.
